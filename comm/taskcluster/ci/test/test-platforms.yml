# This file maps build platforms to test platforms.  In some cases, a
# single build may be tested on multiple test platforms, but a single test
# platform can only link to one build platform.  Both build and test platforms
# are represented as <platform>/<type>, where <type> is what Treeherder calls a
# collection.
#
# Each test platform further specifies the set of tests that will be scheduled
# for the platform, referring to tests defined in test-sets.yml.
#
# Note that set does not depend on the tree; tree-dependent job selection
# should be performed in the target task selection phase of task-graph
# generation.
