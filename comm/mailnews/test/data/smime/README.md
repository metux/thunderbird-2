S/MIME test certificates and messages
=====================================

This directory contains certificates and S/MIME test messages, which are
generated by building NSS and executing a subset of the NSS test suite.

The certificates will expire on the date listed in file expiration.txt

The certificates must be refreshed around the expiration date.
To do so, run the generate.sh script.

Alternatively, join the #nss IRC channel and ask a member of the NSS
team to execute the NSS test suite, and give you a copy of the contents
of this directory:
  tests_results/security/localhost.1/sharedb/smime/tb/
